# BB84 Simulation
The BB84 is a protocol to distribute a safe criptographic key using quantum mechanical properties, developed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984. It was the firts quantum cryptography protocol ever designed. It's a method to securely communicating a private key formed by a random sequence of zeros and one from one person to another. This not possible using classical phisics methods, as it's always possible that key may be intercepted during transmission without the two people now knowing. Quantum mechanics instead makes the creation of such a secure key possible. Understanding how this protocol works also allows to graps the uniqueness and potential of quantum mechanics in techonological, computational and cryprographic applications.

The protocol works in the following way: particles with spin 1⁄2 are sent from a person, let's call her Alice, to the intended receiver of the message, let's call him Bob. Before sengin the particles, Alice prepares each of them in a spin-state that is either spin-up (coded in binary as 1) or spin-down (coded in binary as 0) in either one of two different orthogonal axes, in our case the horizontal one X and the vertical one Z. We'll refer to these as the base on which the measurement is done (horizontal/X or vertical/Z). The preparation is done by using a Stern-Gerlach apparatus, which creates a magnetic field alighed in a chosen direction.

For spin 1/2 particles, the particles separate into two discrete streams, one deflected in the positive direction (we'll code this a bit of value 1), one deflected in the negative direction (coded as a bit of value 0). By orienting the Stern-Gerlach along the two orthogonal axes X and Z it's possible to decide in which base each measurement is done. The measurements done by Alice are always done randomly chosing the base, and the results are always randomly either 1 or 0. The states |↑> and |↓> along the Z axis are consideread as 1 and 0 outcomes, and |+> and |-> in the X directionas are considered with outcomes of 1 and 0 respectively. Now she has two strings, one of bases she chose and one of the results she got. She sends each particle to Bob, who is also equipped with a Stern-Gerlach apparatus. Bob too notes the series of X or Z and the relative valus of 0 or 1 for each particle sent by Alice. Because of the behaviour of quantum particles when passing through a Stern-Gerlach apparatus they know that their outcomes are always equal when they both happened to choose the same base. If they instead chose two different bases, Bob's result will be random.

After completing the measurements, they publicly share whith each other the complete list of bases used for the measurements. Comparing these, the keep only those values for which their bases were the same. This new and shorter list of bits is going to be their shared key. Alice and Bob then exchange a certain number of random bits of their key to check for errors. If there is no error, everything went correctly, and they use some cryprographic tecnique to share their message using the shared key known only to them.

If they found errors the key is not safe because it means someone eavesdropped. This person, let's call her Eve, tried to intercept the particles with her own Stern-Gerlach apparatus. She puts herself between Alice and Bob to incercept the key, but she doesn't know what bases Alice or Bob are choosing, so she can only guess. When she guesses wrong, the direction of the spin of the particle changes. So, when Bob does his measurement, it's possibile that he chooses the same base as Alice, but not the same as Eve. In doing so, he now only has a 50% chance of getting the same result as Alice. The other 50% of the time there is a mismatch between the results of the mearument done by Alice and Bob, and they can infer someone is eavesdropping, therefore they will not use the key which is not safe.
